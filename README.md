# submodule_test_master
A git experiment for submodule.
This repo will use submodule_test_sub as library. Each pull should get both main and sub file.

Use `git submodule add [repo_url]` to add repo as subfolder. In this case, submodule_test_sub is added to this repo. Similar to `git clone [repo_url]`, a folder name can be provided as folder name instead of module name like `git submodule add [repo_url] [folder_name]`. I added submodule_test_sub as libs again.
